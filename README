This is a /dev/crypto device driver, equivalent to those in OpenBSD or
FreeBSD. The main idea is to access of existing ciphers in kernel space 
from userspace, thus enabling re-use of a hardware implementation of a
cipher.

=== How to combine with cryptographic libraries ===

* GnuTLS: 

GnuTLS needs to be compiled with --enable-cryptodev in order to take
advantage of /dev/crypto. GnuTLS 3.0.14 or later is recommended.

* OpenSSL:

The current releases of openssl support /dev/crypto by replacing
eng_cryptodev.c with the version available in the extras subdirectory. 
In order to compile use the -DHAVE_CRYPTODEV -DUSE_CRYPTODEV_DIGESTS flags.
